// This file is used to define the package for the Node.js application.
// It includes metadata such as name, version, description, main file, scripts, author, license, dependencies, and engines.
// It also specifies the version of Node.js required to run the application.
// The "scripts" section defines commands that can be run using npm, such as starting the server or running tests.
// The "devDependencies" section includes development dependencies, such as nodemon, which is used for automatically restarting the server during development.
// The "engines" section specifies the version of Node.js that the application is compatible with.
// The "dependencies" section is empty in this case, as there are no runtime dependencies specified for the application.
